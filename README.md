NTU 107-1 Information Retrieval and Text Mining

### HW1: Write a program to extract terms from a document.  
    1. Tokenization.
    2. Lowercasing everything.
    3. Stemming using Porterâ€™s algorithm.
    4. Stopword removal.
    5. Save the result as a txt file.

### HW2: Write a program to convert a set of documents into tf-idf vectors  
    1. Construct a dictionary based on the terms extracted from the given documents  
        Record the document frequency of each term  
        Save your dictionary as a txt file (dictionary.txt)  
    2. Transfer each document into a tf-idf unit vector  
        Save it as a txt file (DocID.txt)  
    3. Write a function cosine(Docx, Docy) which loads the tf-idf vectors of documents x and y and returns their cosine similarity  

### HW3: Train Multinomial Naive Bayes; Feature Selection (Log Likelyhood Ratio)

### HW4: Hierarchical Clustering
